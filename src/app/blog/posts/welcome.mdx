## Welcome

My name is Joshua Marcum, and securityengineerd.com is my personal blog, portfolio, and resume. I have needed to setup something like this for some time, only recently have I found the opportunity to actually start this little project. For those of you who do not know me in person, I'm a life-long computer geek. It was an obsession that started as a child and grew into a career in cybersecurity. I'm taking this as an opportunity to give back to the community some of the knowledge that I have learned over my many years working in different engineering roles.

I understand content may be limited for the moment, however it will grow. Hopefully this is a good opportunity to network and find find a new contract. My last role has recently ended, I am available for work if anyone is interested. ;)
